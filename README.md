## Platform Overview

The **B2B Agent Orchestrator** is a production-grade, multi-agent AI system that automates the entire B2B sales qualification pipeline. From the moment a trigger event is detected -- whether from an RSS feed, a GitHub repository update, a News API article, or a LinkedIn signal via Apify -- the platform autonomously orchestrates a fleet of specialized AI agents to research, enrich, score, validate, and ultimately qualify sales prospects against configurable Ideal Customer Profile criteria.

What sets this platform apart is its **dynamic orchestration layer**. Rather than relying on static, hardcoded pipelines, the system employs an LLM-powered Dynamic Planner that inspects the current workflow state and intelligently selects the next agent to execute based on accumulated data, missing signals, and configured ICP criteria. This approach enables the pipeline to adapt in real-time, re-route on failure, and even execute agents in parallel when dependency graphs allow.

The platform is designed with a **defense-in-depth reliability model**, augmented by stochastic mathematical models and heuristic optimization functions. Every agent is wrapped in a `SafeAgentWrapper` that provides fault isolation, automatic retry tracking, and execution tracing. External service calls are protected by a three-state circuit breaker (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN) featuring heuristic decision scoring to validate state transitions. Event ingestion follows the outbox pattern with orphan cleanup to guarantee exactly-once processing semantics, while LLM outputs pass through strict regex sanitization pipelines to ensure data integrity. Human-in-the-loop governance ensures that no prospect moves to outreach without configurable approval gates.

+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Protocol-Based Dependency Inversion** -- All service contracts are defined as `typing.Protocol` interfaces (`LLMServiceProtocol`, `ScrapingServiceProtocol`, `EnrichmentServiceProtocol`). The `Toolbox` facade accepts these protocols, enabling concrete implementations to be swapped without modifying agent code. This is not theoretical -- it directly enables test mocking without subclassing.

**2. Decorator-Based Agent Registration** -- The `@register_agent` decorator automatically registers agent classes with the global `AgentRegistry` singleton. The graph builder in `graph.py` dynamically wires all registered agents into the `StateGraph`, meaning adding a new agent requires zero changes to the graph construction code (Open/Closed Principle).

**3. Annotated State Reducers** -- The `GraphState` TypedDict uses Python `Annotated` types with custom reducer functions (`add_dict`, `add_list`) to safely merge state updates from parallel agent execution branches. This eliminates race conditions in concurrent fan-out/fan-in patterns.

**4. Outbox Pattern Event Processing** -- The `TriggerMonitor` implements a two-phase event processing pattern: events are marked as `"processing"` before workflow submission and updated to `"completed"` only after successful dispatch. A background cleanup job recovers orphaned `"processing"` events, guaranteeing at-least-once delivery semantics.

---

## Agent Orchestration Engine

The heart of the platform is the **LangGraph-powered orchestration engine** that manages agent lifecycle, routing, and state management:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DynamicPlanner
    
    DynamicPlanner --> ResearcherNode: Missing market context
    DynamicPlanner --> EnricherNode: Missing firmographics
    DynamicPlanner --> TechStackDetector: Missing tech stack
    DynamicPlanner --> ScoreNode: Data gathered, needs scoring
    DynamicPlanner --> CrossValidator: Needs validation
    DynamicPlanner --> PersonaMatcher: Needs persona matching
    DynamicPlanner --> ContactFinder: Needs decision makers
    DynamicPlanner --> CompetitorIntel: Needs competitive context
    DynamicPlanner --> OutreachGenerator: Contacts found, draft emails
    DynamicPlanner --> Summarizer: All data gathered
    DynamicPlanner --> CustomAgentExecutor: Custom agent needed
    DynamicPlanner --> HitlGateway: Ready for review
    DynamicPlanner --> End: Pipeline complete
    
    ResearcherNode --> DynamicPlanner
    EnricherNode --> DynamicPlanner
    TechStackDetector --> DynamicPlanner
    ScoreNode --> DynamicPlanner
    CrossValidator --> DynamicPlanner
    PersonaMatcher --> DynamicPlanner
    ContactFinder --> DynamicPlanner
    CompetitorIntel --> DynamicPlanner
    OutreachGenerator --> DynamicPlanner
    Summarizer --> DynamicPlanner
    CustomAgentExecutor --> DynamicPlanner
    
    HitlGateway --> OutputDispatcher: Approved
    HitlGateway --> End: Rejected
    OutputDispatcher --> [*]
    End --> [*]
```

### Dynamic Planning Algorithm

The `DynamicPlannerNode` uses a three-tier routing strategy:

1. **Custom Workflow Enforcement** -- If a custom workflow DAG is attached to the prospect, the planner performs topological traversal of the DAG, dispatching agents whose dependencies have been satisfied. This enables parallel execution of independent branches.

2. **LLM-Powered Intelligent Routing** -- When no custom workflow is present, the planner constructs a context-aware prompt containing the current state, available (unexecuted) agents, and routing rules. The LLM returns a JSON response specifying the optimal next agent.

3. **Deterministic Fallback** -- If the LLM fails or returns an invalid response, the planner falls back to a deterministic linear sequence, ensuring the pipeline always makes forward progress.

## Reliability Engineering

The platform implements **defense-in-depth reliability** across every layer:

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

A three-state finite state machine protects all external service calls:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CLOSED
    CLOSED --> OPEN: Failures >= Threshold
    OPEN --> HALF_OPEN: Reset Timeout Expired
    HALF_OPEN --> CLOSED: Probe Success
    HALF_OPEN --> OPEN: Probe Failure
```

### Fault Isolation via SafeAgentWrapper

Every agent is wrapped in a `SafeAgentWrapper` that:
- Catches all unhandled exceptions without crashing the LangGraph workflow
- Tracks per-agent retry counts in the graph state
- Records execution duration and trace metadata
- Allows LangGraph control flow exceptions (`GraphInterrupt`, `NodeInterrupt`) to propagate

### Outbox Pattern for Event Processing

```
TriggerMonitor.poll_sources()
    |
    v
mark_event_processed(status="processing")   <-- Phase 1: Intent
    |
    v
workflow_service.submit_prospect(state)      <-- External call
    |
    v
update_event_status(status="completed")      <-- Phase 2: Confirmation
    |
    (If crash between Phase 1 and Phase 2)
    |
    v
_cleanup_orphaned_events()                   <-- Background recovery
```

### LLM Multi-Provider Failover

The `LLMService` maintains dual provider pools (Gemini + Groq) with round-robin rotation and automatic failover:

```
Request --> Groq Pool [model_1, model_2, ..., model_n]
                |
                | (all models exhausted)
                v
            Gemini Pool [model_1, model_2, ..., model_n]
                |
                | (all models exhausted)
                v
            Return Fallback Response
```
